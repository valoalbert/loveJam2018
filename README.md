<h1>Adam's Decision</h1>
<p>Game made for the Love Jam 2018, made from scratch</p>
<p>You will need to download love engine from their webpage and install it. Then you will be able to compile the code for multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Freesound.org,  @OzzedNet at twitter for the background music, open game art and 'NicoleMarieProductions' on OpenGameArt for the heart and my lover @FrynosHue for the sprites.</p>
